            <h1>Animation Project</h1>
            <p>Inside this animation: I created a brown face without a body attached to it, floating in what seems to be space. My character’s face has a wide smile on it, as he formally greets you, this is because the emotion I was inspired to imitating was “Happy” as it appears that he’s meeting somebody new, telling them that “My Name is Flash”. For my shapes I used the Rectangle tool. Rounded rectangle tool and the Ellipse tool. My animation changed a little bit from my storyboard; to my actual project, I gave my storyboard project more hair, I didn’t use the words “Hey” and I didn’t follow the same transition paths that I created.
         But I did add some properties to my animation like rotations with my text and background, opacity for my text, position and anchor points for all the parts of the face.
