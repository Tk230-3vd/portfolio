               <figcaption>For my old school image, I decided to choose a woods/fall background. I wanted the image to give off spooky because we are now approaching Halloween day. I added a house that was originally a part of another background photo, to make it appear as some haunted house. I used the sky and moon from the third photo and replaced it with the sky from my first image to fully get the halloween feel and then used one of my own photos to complete it.  </figcaption>
